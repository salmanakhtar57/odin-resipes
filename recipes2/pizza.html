    <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough 
        topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature, 
        traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.</p>
